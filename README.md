# movies_app

This app is cross-platform mobile application using Flutter, 
consisting of two main screens: the home screen and the details 
screen. The application features three distinct categoriesâ€”popular 
movies, top-rated movies, and user-selected favourites. The home 
screen serves as a hub for users to navigate through these categories 
seamlessly.
Within each category, users can explore a curated list of movies, and 
upon selecting a particular movie, they are directed to the details 
screen for a comprehensive overview. The details screen provides indepth information about the selected movie, including its synopsis, 
cast, and other relevant details. Additionally, users have the option 
to mark movies as their favourites by clicking on the like button.
The favourite functionality is a key feature of the application, 
allowing users to curate a personalized list of preferred movies. 
When a user clicks the like button on the details screen, the 
corresponding movie is added to their favourite movie list. This 
feature enhances the user experience by enabling them to easily 
track and revisit their most beloved films.
In summary, my Flutter application seamlessly integrates a userfriendly interface with a sophisticated navigation system, providing 
users with the ability to explore popular and top-rated movies, as 
well as curate their own list of favourite films for a personalized and 
engaging cinematic experience.
